# guess_my_number
Here I present to you a small, ugly application (I must admit, decoration is not my strong point) for playing the guessing game with the computer.
The principle is simple: you imagine a number that the computer will try to guess.
More specifically, the power of [search algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-algorithms/), including dichotomous search, are used to allow the computer to find your choice as quickly as possible.
